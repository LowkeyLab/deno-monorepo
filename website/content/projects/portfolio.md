# Developer Portfolio

This project is my personal portfolio website, built to showcase my projects and skills as a software engineer. It serves as both a demonstration of my front-end abilities and a central hub for information about my work.

## Features

- Responsive design that works on all devices
- Dark/light mode toggle
- Project showcase with filtering capabilities
- Fast performance with minimal JavaScript
- Built using modern web technologies

## Technical Details

The site uses Astro as its framework, providing excellent performance through its partial hydration approach. Tailwind CSS and DaisyUI provide the styling foundation, making it easy to maintain consistent design across the site.
