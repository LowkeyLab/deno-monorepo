## About Advent of Code

Advent of Code is an annual series of programming puzzles that are released daily from December 1st to December 25th. Each day presents two related challenges that can be solved using any programming language or approach.

## My Approach

I focus on writing clean, maintainable code that solves the puzzles efficiently. My solutions include:

- Parsing input data effectively
- Implementing appropriate algorithms
- Writing tests to verify solution correctness
- Documenting my thought process and approach

## Technologies Used

- Deno runtime for a modern JavaScript environment
- TypeScript for type safety and better developer experience
- Test-driven development for solution verification
